                <p>I am a bootcamp student learning to code for my first time.
                    I currently work as a CNC machinist at Chemglass Machine,
                    but I am looking for a career change.
                    I want to learn how to develope websites, software, and/or games on my coding journey.
                    I have many hobbies which include
                    gaming, table-top gaming, piano, chicken farming, fantasy football, watching anime, smoking
                    meat/cooking,
                    and now coding of course.
                    I am excited to see where coding can take my career and how I will evolve as a person learning
                    these new skills.</p>

                    <p>I was given started code for this project and I was given the task of refactoring the code.
                        I stared by adding HTML elements where the div tags were.
                        I also consolidated the CSS stylesheet into smaller groups for oranization purposes.

                    <p>I worked on this project as my first website and was given a starting template. I added in extra
                        notes into the boxes for each section and also added in an image of the CSS rule.</p>

                    <p>I started this website from scratch and added all the code myself. I made a wireframe first then
                        implemented the wireframe to the website throught HTML and CSS.
                        I made 6 different code snippets with decriptions and made the snippets able to be copied and
                        pasted if the users wishes.

                <p>My current experience is in machining for the last couple of years. It is not very relevant to
                    developement,
                    but I think some skills can transfer like logical thinking, problem solving, and work ethic.</p>
